# Dictionary using Binary Search Tree Variants
 
- Implementation of a dictionary CLI application that allows efficient search, insertion and deletion operations using AVL trees or Red Black Trees.

- AVL trees are known for their faster search operations and are best suited for scenarios where search operations are more frequent than insertion or deletion. On the other hand, Red-Black trees are more balanced and are better suited for scenarios where both search and insertion/deletion operations are equally important.

# Functionalities

- Initialize type of tree that used in the dictionary.
- Insert a new word to your dictionary (this word exists once in the dictionary).
- Delete a word in the dictionary.
- Search for a word.
- Insert more than one word using a file by adding the file path to the batch insert function.
- Delete more than one word using a file by adding the file path to the batch delete function.
- Get the number of words that exist in the dictionary.
